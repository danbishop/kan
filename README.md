## Install
For now, during dev do the following:

`sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev libssl-dev`

`sudo gem install bundler`

`bundle config set path 'vendor/bundle'`

`bundle install`

## Server

Again, during current state start the server with:

`bundle exec ruby server.rb`

## Client

And also in the project's present state, start the client with:

`bundle exec ruby client.rb`
